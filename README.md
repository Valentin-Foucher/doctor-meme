# Doctor Meme

A meme a day keeps the doctor away ðŸ˜„. In that manner, I designed this CLI that can either be run manually or
automatically on startup.
The list of playlists I am using is non exhaustive and can be lengthened.

## How to use

Run the app like this:
```bash
make run
```

You can also save the app in your binaries to run it from anywhere:
```bash
make save
```

And then:
```bash
doctor-meme
```
